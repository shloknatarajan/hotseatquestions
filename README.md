# The Hottest Seat @ hottestseat.com
Basically an online version of the hotseat board game/drinking game with questions scraped some various reddit threads. Works as designed and mobile responsive but I think the questions themselves need to be improved. Another issue might be the whole premise itself since what makes hot seat fun is your friends know what questions to ask that you won't want to answer which is hard to replicate online.
