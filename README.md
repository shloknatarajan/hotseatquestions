# The Hottest Seat @ hottestseat.com
Basically an online version of the hotseat board game/drinking game with questions scraped some various reddit threads.

Works as designed and mobile responsive but I think the questions themselves need to be improved. One major issue with replicating the fun of the traditional hot seat drinking game is that your friends know what questions to ask which is hard to replicate online.

These are some of the more PG question examples.

Future Ideas:
- Custom decks that users can upload
- Shared game rooms 
- More preset deck options
